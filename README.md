# Automated-Co-op-Enrolment-Confirmation-Letter-Generator
This project automates the creation of personalized Co-op enrollment confirmation letters directly from Google Sheets using Google Apps Script &amp; Google Docs.  It was designed to save time and reduce errors when generating letters for 100+ students, eliminating the need for manual copy-paste edits in Google Docs.

This tool was built as part of a summer job to streamline the Co-op officeâ€™s workflow. Staff can now generate dozens of confirmation letters in seconds instead of manually editing templates for each student.

## Technology Used
- Google Apps Script (JavaScript-based)
